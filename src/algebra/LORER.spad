)abbrev category LORER LeftOreRing

++ Description:
++   This is category of left ore rings, that is noncommutaive
++   rings without zero divisors where we can compute least left
++   common multiple

LeftOreRing() : Category == EntireRing with
   lcmCoef : (%, %) -> Record(llcm_res : %, coeff1 : %, coeff2 : %)
     ++ lcmCoef(c1, c2) computes (llcm_res, coeff1, coeff2) such that
     ++ llcm_res is least left common multiple of c1 and c2
     ++ and llcm_res = coeff1*c1 = coeff2*c2
